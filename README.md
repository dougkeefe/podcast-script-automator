   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and configuration:
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
   HOSTING_API_ENDPOINT=https://xuwhkphkbckhrpvyjfbp.supabase.co/functions/v1/create-episode
   PODCAST_ID=your_podcast_id_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
node script.js <audio_file_path> <content_url> <publish_date> <publish_time>
```

### Parameters:

- `<audio_file_path>`: Path to your audio file (supports various formats, will be converted to MP3)
- `<content_url>`: URL of the content to base the podcast metadata on
- `<publish_date>`: Date for publishing the podcast (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### Example:

```bash
node script.js ./recordings/episode42.wav "https://example.com/article" "2023-05-15" "10:30"
```

## Workflow

1. The script fetches content from the provided URL and converts it to markdown
2. Claude AI analyzes the content and generates a title and description
3. The audio file is analyzed to determine its duration
4. The audio is converted to MP3 format with optimized settings
5. The episode is uploaded to your podcast hosting service with the generated metadata
6. Detailed logs are provided throughout the process

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CLAUDE_API_KEY`: Your API key for Claude AI
- `HOSTING_API_ENDPOINT`: The API endpoint for your podcast hosting service
- `PODCAST_ID`: The ID of your podcast on the hosting service

### Audio Conversion Settings

The script uses the following FFmpeg settings for audio conversion:
- Format: MP3
- Audio channels: 2 (stereo)
- Sample rate: 48000 Hz
- Bitrate: 192 kbps
- Metadata: Preserves original metadata
- ID3 tags: Adds ID3v2.3 and ID3v1 tags

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following:

- **Timezone**: Change the `ATLANTIC_TIMEZONE` constant in `script.js` to your preferred timezone
